<h1>HAPL Teen Advisory Board Reaches 500 Summer Volunteer Hours!</h1>
<p>Shortly before the school year began, the <i>Hudson Area Public Library</i>
 Teen Advisory Board; known as TAB reached 500 volunteer hours throughout the summer.
</p>
<h2>What does TAB do?</h2>
<p>They are a group dedicated to helping the library. They have meetings twice a month to discuss changes that can be made at the library. They also help with various library events, including but not limited to; the TAB carnival, reptile parties, various craft-related classes, and decorating the library for holidays.</p>
<h2>What does this mean for TAB?</h2>
<p>Due to a their effort of a combined <b>500 hours</b> of hard work to help the library, they got to have an after hours party on <b>Friday, August 26th</b> to celebrate their past and continued effort to help the community. </p>
<q>I wish every community had a group like this</q>
